# Phosphor Icons

Phosphor is a flexible icon family for interfaces, diagrams, presentations — whatever, really. Explore all our icons at [phosphoricons.com](https://phosphoricons.com).

## Adobe XD Plugin

Browse, search, and copy into your project all from within Adobe XD! Installation details coming soon!

## Raw Assets

If you'd like to use the assets directly, you can download our [asset kit](https://www.phosphoricons.com/assets/phosphor-icons.zip).

- **SVGs** – Individual icon SVGs, in both minified and original formats retaining design-time detail.
- **Icon Font** – Use the icons as you would text, in print and other applications where full-fledged graphical elements are undesirable.

<!-- ### Source Files
- **Sketch**
- **Illustrator**
- **Figma** -->
